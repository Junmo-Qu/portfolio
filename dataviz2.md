### For this assignment, I chose to visualize the government debt data in a bar chart, grid of line charts, and a heatmap. Data used by all visualizations on this page are general government debt from the OECD's data download site. The general government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator of the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of many categories here. The purpose of these visualizations of debt-to-GDP ratios over time for different countries is to give the reader a quick overview of the impact of past government deficits. 

### The first chart only shows government debt as a percentage of GDP for different countries in 2019. While the second and third charts show the change in ratios of government debt to GDP for different countries over time (1995-2021). In all three visualizations, when the cursor slides over a bar, line, or square, the value of debt-to-GDP at that location will appear. For a single year, a bar chart is a good choice to clearly compare different countries. For multiple years, however, bar charts can not provide a good representation of the change in debt-to-GDP ratios across countries. This is why the grid of line chart and the heatmap were chosen for the 2nd and 3rd visualization. The line chart can react to the trend by the tendency of the line and the heatmap by colors.

### For the third visualization, I chose the heatmap because it allows both a horizontal view of the change in debt-to-GDP ratios for each country over years, and a vertical view of the difference in debt-to-GDP ratios for different countries in the same year. The line chart is unable to do this. Also for the colors, I chose orange and blue, a set of contrasting colors, the darker the color the closer to the most value (maximum and minimum). We can see that squares with large debt-to-GDP ratios (especially over 130) show orange, which may indicate government deficits, while years or countries with small ratios are blue. We can see that the ratios for most countries are broadly trending upward over time and are mostly below 130 at various times. Among them, Japan, Greece, Italy, and Belgium stay high with worrying government financial situations. However, because of Florish's limited color customization, the color gradients do not work very well. It would be better if the color gradient is larger and the center value can be adjusted.
