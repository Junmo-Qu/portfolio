## Final Data Story
End Product: [Where is My Wife?](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/where-is-my-wife/index.html)

The story starts with the current situation where a huge number of men in China are having difficulty getting married, analyzes the reasons for this phenomenon, the far-reaching effects of too many men, and the unexpected result of China's one-child policy: the awakening of female power. The project aims to raise awareness of gender issues and call for action for gender equality.

## Audience and Adjustments
After the user interviews were completed, I made adjustments to the intended audience for the story and accordingly adjusted the overall story structure. Eventually, the intended audience for this story was identified as the following three categories. The first category is Chinese people who are concerned about the social situation they are in. The second category is anyone who is concerned about social phenomena in Asia. They may be businessmen who want to invest or explore Asian markets, or they may be scholars who are studying specific topics. The third category is feminists or human rights activists, working to raise awareness of equality.

To better tell the story to the intended audience, I changed the original three chapters into five parts: current situation, reasons, alarming impact, unexpected results, and actions we can take. The story begins with shocking numbers to introduce the fact that a great number of men in China are currently unable to get married, then analyzes the causes of this phenomenon, that is, the one-child policy has led to a large number of abortions and abandonment of girls. Then it aims to draw attention to the negative effects of too many men and the windfall of the one-child policy. The final part calls for action to promote gender equality.

## Work Summary

### Observations
From the user interviews in Part II and the communication with the professor, the following findings helped me to determine the final direction and ideas for the revision. Firstly, ensuring that the story resonates with the target audience is essential, it will maximize the impact of the story. This required us to understand the intended audience well enough and build a compelling story frame, but the frame I had in Part II at that time did not succeed in making an emotional connection with the audience.

Secondly, we can clearly tell the audience a role they can play after they leave the story through a call to action part which comes right before the end of a compelling story. The CTA gives the audience concrete tasks to tackle, and these tasks are ones that must be completed in order to bring our ideas to fruition. Itâ€™s a key part to make the story persuasive. I decided to not include the CTA part at first, but after I talk to more people and the professor, I got to know I'm wrong with this decision. An audience might be gripped by my narrative and convinced by the story, but if they leave not knowing what they are supposed to do with the ideas the story wants to convey, the story will have been essentially fruitless.

Thirdly, the story must be logical and continuous. Readers are very sensitive and they will be confused about illogicalities and then become suspicious, which reduces their trust and engagement in the story. Almost every person interviewed said they did not understand the adoption part, and one interviewee expressed confusion about chapter 3.


### Design Decisions
Taking the observations into account, I changed my overall narrative ways and structure of the story. To begin with, I abandoned the series structure and replaced it with a logical structure of phenomenon, cause, effect, outcome, and action. Except for the effect and action parts, the other three parts are illustrated with data visualizations to enhance user perception and improve the credibility of the story. In addition, I added headings to each part so that the audience can know exactly what the next part is about when reading. Considering picture copyright and portrait rights, I avoided using images of real people. Regarding the comment about reducing the number of visualizations mentioned in Part II, I weighed it and did not take it. The phenomenon needs a large number of data to explain it, and visualizations can help readers quickly understand it. In combination with the later changed story structure, there is no problem of appearing cluttered.

Compared to the storyboard in Part II, the final story has changed a lot. So I conducted additional user interviews and made some adjustments based on the feedback. On this occasion, the changes were huge and the time was intense, but based on the results of the interviews, there was higher satisfaction and fewer problems.
