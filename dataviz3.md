## Original Data Visualization

The world is losing forests on a large scale every year, with a large portion of this occurring in the tropics. Deforestation is one of the largest sources of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, driven primarily by expanding forestry and agriculture. Although agricultural expansion is increasingly driven by foreign demand, the links between deforestation and foreign demand for agricultural commodities have only been partially mapped. If we want to address deforestation, we need to know what causes it. 

There are large geographic variations in what commodities are associated with deforestation-related emissions. A good visualization of the results can provide the rationale for governments to guide agricultural production and help scientists to innovate ways to produce them. The relevant chart in the selected article has some redundancies and is not intuitive enough for non-professionals such as government officials and farmers to read. Therefore, it is selected for detailed critique and redesign.
