# Effects of the One-Child Policy on Gender Equality 
In 2015, China's one-child policy, which had been conducted for 35 years, came to an end, and the country has now entered the three-child era. There are many theoretical studies on the impact of the one-child policy on women, but the field of presentation of relevant data and overall narratives is still a gap. Taking the opportunity of the final project, I decided to tell the story using data visualization methods.
