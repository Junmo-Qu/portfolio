### Target Audience and Recruitment Plan

#### Target Audience

The target audience I hope to reach with my story meets one or more of the following criteria.
- People who know very little about the demographic situation in mainland China. 
- People who are interested in the basic information about China's demographic.
- Ordinary people who are concerned with special social phenomena on a daily basis.

#### Recruitment Plan

My approach to identifying representative interviewees is to highlight the recruitment types when recruiting. For this project, respondents have to meet three requirements: be an adult, not a mainland Chinese citizen, and have a habit of reading world news. I will recruit these people by the following methods.

_Face-to-face Invitation._
I will try to recruit the staff in the bookstore, cafeteria, etc. as interviewees on campus. I will confirm whether they are my recruiter type first, then explain the reason for the visit, the purpose of the interview, and a brief introduction to the project at a time that will not disturb their work. After they understand the situation, I will seek their permission and schedule the interview.

_Email Invitation._
I will compile an email template that politely states my purpose, a brief introduction to the assignment, and my recruitment types. Send this email to some targeted students and professors to seek their approval.


### Goals and Questions

| Goals | Questions | 
|---|---|
|Test whether the reader understands the main idea of the story.|Can the reader understand what the story is trying to say?|
|Confirm the logic of the story.|Is the story logical in terms of content, sequence, narrative style, etc.?|
|Evaluate the readability and effectiveness of the visualization.| What are users' suggestions for visualizations? Do users feel that the visualizations appear where they make sense and are helpful to understand?|
|Prioritize what to adjust.|What problems are repeatedly mentioned?|


### Methods

Conduct interviews with each selected participant for 10-15 minutes through in-person or online meetings. Take notes and record screens during the interviews, organize and summarize the findings after the interviews, and think about areas where visualization can be improved.


### Interview Script

Here is the [Interview Script](/Script.md).


### User Profile

Audience 1: Student, early 20's, American, very interested in Chinese news because her mother is Chinese

Audience 2: Student, early 30's, Indian, read the news every day

Audience 3: Bookstore staff, mid 30's, American, read the news every day

Audience 4: Student, mid 20's, Italian, enjoy following all kinds of interesting news and phenomenon


### Findings, Insights, and Opportunities

| Findings | Insights | Opportunities | 
|---|---|---|
| “If you want to talk about the phenomenon of men having a hard time getting married, you can talk less about the adoption part. I don't see how the two are related, but the adoption story is touching.”| It makes sense. There is no direct link between a large number of female babies being adopted and men failing to find wives. | Streamline Selah's story or just delete it and write something else. |
| "I like the picture in the adoption section, the 80% 20% one, but the colors don't match the style of your overall article." | More people may be asked to determine if this part should be adjusted. The original color scheme is intended to use blue for boys and pink for girls. | Change the color scheme of the visualization. | 
| “You could add more pictures of real people. Although I don't think the adoption story makes sense, those pictures are great.” | A suggestion that can be adopted. But pictures of real people can easily have copyright problems and are not easy to find. | Add more pictures of real people to improve the overall performance. | 
| “Why do you tell the story of adoption? I think it makes more sense for you to talk about the ratio of males to females in abandoned babies than the ratio in adopted babies.” | Very useful advice and inspired me to talk about the causes of the abnormal sex ratio at birth, which is the preference for boys. | Replace the data in the adoption part with that of the abandoned babies. | 
| "I think you have too many statistical graphs, I don't need to see data from 1970 to 2100 when I want to know some information. It's much better to tell me directly what the result is, like the 34 million at the top of the article." | It's a stereotype I have, thanks to this class and these interviews that keep reminding me of it. | Reduce the number of statistical type visualizations and do some other more straightforward and simple data visualizations. | 
| “Data visualization images are not very clear.” | This has also been discovered by myself. The current visualizations are not final versions and will be further optimized. | Looking for ways to improve image clarity. | 
| “There are too many charts and they appear at the same time. Promise me you won't add any more charts.” | Unimportant visualizations are not only meaningless, but can also be distracting to the audience. | Reduce the number of charts. | 
| “It says that the number of women is much less than men at the beginning of the article, and here it says that this guy dated 15 women this year, which is very contradictory.” | Very interesting and reasonable comment. But I still want to keep the story for now and will look for other ways to solve the problem. | Adjust the narrative way of the story in chapter 3. | 
| “The paragraph about adoption doesn't make sense, and it only mentions the US. Why can't it be that Americans like girls more so they adopt more girls?” | An area that has been repeatedly mentioned and must be taken seriously and revised. | Delete or streamline this part. | 
| "I know this is not your final version, but I have a feeling that your story will be very very long, and you also have so many data visualizations. Readers will probably get tired and can't finish reading." | Need to wait until the final version is completed, and then see the situation to make targeted adjustments. | Pay attention when writing stories. | 
| “I'd like to see some leading phrases, like the first sentence at the beginning, otherwise the whole story would be very flat.” | Very useful tips for narrative style, using headings or highlighting phrases to highlight plots and focus. | Add visual effects at key plot points and turning points. | 


### Conclusion
The main problem is focused on the logic of the story narrative, especially the adoption story part in chapter 1. Three of the four respondents indicated that they did not see a cause-effect relationship before and after, as if this small story was an outsider. One respondent expressed confusion about the story in chapter 3. To solve these problems, I am going to make adjustments to the two stories‘ structures. I will streamline the adoption story into a small paragraph and consider other narrative ways to tell the story in chapter 3. 

Another area that needs to be adjusted is the number and form of the visualizations. Two respondents said there were too many visualizations during the story, and one respondent expressed dissatisfaction that the visualizations were all high-level summary statistics. I had planned to add some more statistical types of visualizations, but now the plan changed to do some streamlining. I will think about how to make some of the data visualizations simple and prominent. Overall, the user research and interviews provided a tremendous boost to my project.
