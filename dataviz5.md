### Target Audience and Recruitment Plan

#### Target Audience

The target audience I hope to reach with my story meets one or more of the following criteria.
- People who know very little about the demographic situation in mainland China. 
- People who are interested in the basic information about China's demographic.
- Ordinary people who are concerned with special social phenomena on a daily basis.

#### Recruitment Plan

My approach to identifying representative interviewees is to highlight the recruitment types when recruiting. For this project, respondents have to meet three requirements: be an adult, not a mainland Chinese citizen, and have a habit of reading world news. I will recruit these people by the following methods.

_Face-to-face Invitation._
I will try to recruit the staff in the bookstore, cafeteria, etc. as interviewees on campus. I will confirm whether they are my recruiter type first, then explain the reason for the visit, the purpose of the interview, and a brief introduction to the project at a time that will not disturb their work. After they understand the situation, I will seek their permission and schedule the interview.

_Email Invitation._
I will compile an email template that politely states my purpose, a brief introduction to the assignment, and my recruitment types. Send this email to some targeted students and professors to seek their approval.

### Methods

Conduct interviews with each selected participant for 10-15 minutes through in-person or online meetings. Take notes and record screens during the interviews, organize and summarize the findings after the interviews, and think about areas where visualization can be improved.

### Conclusion
The main problem is focused on the logic of the story narrative, especially the adoption story part in chapter 1. Three of the four respondents indicated that they did not see a cause-effect relationship before and after, as if this small story was an outsider. One respondent expressed confusion about the story in chapter 3. To solve these problems, I am going to make adjustments to the two stories‘ structures. I will streamline the adoption story into a small paragraph and consider other narrative ways to tell the story in chapter 3. 

Another area that needs to be adjusted is the number and form of the visualizations. Two respondents said there were too many visualizations during the story, and one respondent expressed dissatisfaction that the visualizations were all high-level summary statistics. I had planned to add some more statistical types of visualizations, but now the plan changed to do some streamlining. I will think about how to make some of the data visualizations simple and prominent. Overall, the user research and interviews provided a tremendous boost to my project.
