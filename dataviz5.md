### Target Audience and Recruitment Plan

#### Target Audience

The target audience I hope to reach with my story meets one or more of the following criteria.
- People who know very little about the demographic situation in mainland China. 
- People who are interested in the basic information about China's demographic.
- Ordinary people who are concerned with special social phenomena on a daily basis.

#### Recruitment Plan

My approach to identifying representative interviewees is to highlight the recruitment types when recruiting. For this project, respondents have to meet three requirements: be an adult, not a mainland Chinese citizen, and have a habit of reading world news. I will recruit these people by the following methods.

_Face-to-face Invitation_

I will try to recruit the staff in the bookstore, cafeteria, etc. as interviewees on campus. I will confirm whether they are my recruiter type first, then explain the reason for the visit, the purpose of the interview, and a brief introduction to the project at a time that will not disturb their work. After they understand the situation, I will seek their permission and schedule the interview.

_Email Invitation_

I will compile an email template that politely states my purpose, a brief introduction to the assignment, and my recruitment types. Send this email to some targeted students and professors to seek their approval.
