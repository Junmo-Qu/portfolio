# Storyboard Testing Script

## Introduction
Hi! My name is Junmo Qu. Firstly, thank you so much in advance for agreeing to participate in this interview. 
Our goal today is to get feedback on a storyboard I am designing. The test is that I will show you the entire storyboard and make some brief introductions. 
When it's over, I hope you can tell me what makes sense, what's confusing, and what you think is not good or could be improved. 
All feedback is anonymous and the whole test will take you about 10-15 minutes.

## Consent
Before we begin, I would like to first ask you for your permission to record the audio of the interview.
Please be aware that all of the feedback will be kept confidential and de-identified. 
The information I collect will only be used for the purpose of this project for the Telling Stories with Data course.

## Main Section
[Show the storyboard and do some brief introductions in the process to let users know what the story is about. 
But avoid naming the design intent to imply the interviewees.]

Please remember there are no wrong answers for you!

Questions:

You've read the whole storyboard, can you tell me what it's mainly trying to say?

Do you think there are any parts of this story that confuse you? Why?

Are there any parts that make sense to you? Why?

Can you tell me what you think is bad or could be improved? Please tell me why you think so.




## CONCLUSION
Thanks so much. Youâ€™ve completed the interview! Before you go, do you have any questions for me?
