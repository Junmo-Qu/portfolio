# Junmo's Portfolio
Hi! This is Junmo Qu's public portfolio at CMU!

## About Me
My name is Junmo Qu, a student in the CMU ETIM program. In fact, I've been working with data for a long time. I studied mathematics and applied mathematics as an undergraduate, but still, a novice when it comes to visualization. I find data visualization very interesting and meaningful and really enjoy devoting time and effort to it, believing that it will be very beneficial to my future career. Hope to become friends with you all!

## What I Hope to Learn
I do want to build some valuable design skills and learn some about design during this course. To be honest, I don't have much drawing talent, so I hope this won't challenge me too much. Most importantly, I want to learn how to tell data-supported stories, which is very important to me. I plan to be a product manager in the future, so I not only have to work with massive volumes of product-related data, but also need to be able to use those data to build a contextual narrative. I'm confident I'll gain a lot from this course.
